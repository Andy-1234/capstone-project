1.We sell computer parts

2.marketer

3.anything to do with computers from building them to installing anti-virus and tech support

4.it will first start out as a simple pc building gig until enough money is saved to where we can build out own pc brand

5.
	1a.software installation
	1b.pc parts

6.full-time and seasonal employees would be prefered but if they show they know what their doing part-time could be acceptable

7.we will sell both locally and through the internet

8.we would put the computers together by hand

9.we need to keep records of all our parts who bought them and where they're going

10.it would start out as a private company and eventually transition to a s corporation when enough capital has been made

11.keeping it private is good cause i stay in 100% control but the downside is that if it goes down so do i; A good thing about a s corporation is that you have limited liability a bad thing is that there are restrcictionson the number and type of shareholders

12.until i can afford to hire and keep employees i would do everything from the building to the accounting

13.
	1a.go international in who we can sell
	2a.eventually establish my own pc brand like omen or alienware
	3a.Optional(if we get big enough we need to start making our own parts for computers such as ram or motherboards made by our own brand)

14.There would be a ned for people to sell the parts and people who know how to put a pc together other than that it would not have a need for much until it gets bigger and we get a need for accountants people to run the office 

15.if they are a skilled worker who knows how to build a pc they would be paid above minimum wage and will start with a bonus of having a percentage off when buying at the store; as for how we'll hire them it will depend on how much they can actually do  and how skilled they are if they have the skills required to do the job than they will be selected

16.Workers will be motivated by having events for things like christmas and other major holidays and not making them mandatory to attend and store discounts

17.i will hire based on skill not any particular charictoristic

18.I will maintain safety while following osha standards and ensuring not to cut costs where safty might be a concern

19. My business ethics are the ends justify the means if no one gets hurt along the way;We would need to import pc parts not found in the usa; and we would do exports of our prebuilts

20. i will most likely be forced to pay a tariff for the things i import/export

21.the commerce will be interstate as we will try to sell not just in our state but to all states through shipping the item it will be regulated by the federal government

22.until we start out own origional parts all we would need to copyright would be our brand but when our origional parts are made we should patent them

23.other shops that sell premade computers or parts

24.we would have to pay a property tax and taxes on the things we ship
